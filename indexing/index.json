Engagement measures critical thought, sentiment measures if a comment is positive or negative.\n\nMeasuring engagement and sentiment allows us to measure the value of our courses. We can use this to identify subject matter experts or those that need help. We can also use it to measure our content, gaining feedback from our users without them having to fill out a survey.\n\nSID presents this information in visual graph format, making it easier for managers to understand the information and identify trends.\n\nSID uses NLP and general ML. The system was trained with > 10,000 expert-rated items\n\nRecommendations: Recommendations present learners with relevant content and learning experiences without the need for them to always search or browse a very large pool of potential learning. They use simple algorithmic system. A number of different factors inform an overall \u2018score\u2019  - including ratings\u2019.\n\nStream uses a combination of users\u2019 skills selections, user profile and role information, dynamic rules for groups, and an algorithmic recommendation engine to surface the right recommendations to the right learners at the right time. This provides Stream administrators with total control over the recommendations that are provided to each group of learners.\nAs learners can be members of many groups, Stream natively creates highly personalised learning journeys and recommendations based on the individual which can adapt over time as their skill choices, progress, completion, and user profile information change.\nOur exclusive campaign and automation tool is powered by aggregated xAPI data in the LRS which can be used to deepen the personalisation of adaptive learning campaigns including proactive interventions that take learners down different pathways as the Stream learning suite adapts to their engagement and performance.\n\nWe have found that our clients can satisfy the level of personalisation and dynamism that they need from the existing native functionality of the Stream learning suite. AI brings its own challenges around content permissions and visibility to the correct groups of learners, so we have chosen to enable administrators to create highly personal recommendations and learning journeys, with full control, and without the need for AI and machine learning., nan\nSocial learning , Stream has a very prolific social aspect threaded throughout. Learning experiences can then have cues for discussion, so learners can leave comments and share thoughts on the content. And this is all within the platform itself, alongside the learning, for simple accessibility and motivation., nan\nUser generated content , User generated content can be added by any users within a Learning Experience of a suitable type. This is automatically then shared with anyone else assigned the same object. The administrator can share this more widely if they choose - but has control over this. Options are links, uploads, text entry or video recorded directly in the browser. Users can also comment on each others' shared contributions. Users can upload video and other self-generated content., nan\nScheduled emails, Scheduled emails can be set for each learning experience, the body and subject of these emails is provided by the administrator and are scheduled around the open/close date of the learning experience or open/close dates of a level in a course type learning experience.\n\nMore advanced notification behaviour can be achieved with Stream Automation, a campaign tool included with Stream Enterprise. This allows the sending of notifications by email or messaging app to learners based on an administrator specified set of waypoints. Stream Automation can cover learning pathways from simple course reminders through to year long multi course certification programs. via data received by Learning Locker (also included with Stream Enterprise)., nan\nSearch , Stream LXP supports just in time learning through deep searching and delivering in the workflow. Powerful search with direct links to the exact content they need, no matter how deep it is hidden within a course or document, nan\nAdvanced Search and Filtering\n              , Using the \u201cGoogle grade search\u201d, users can easily find learning experiences which might be buried deep inside your learning content. Consuming bite-sized experiences has never been easier or more convenient, allowing learners to fit both assigned and self-directed learning into the flow of work. \n, nan\nFeedback and evaluations , Learners are prompted to leave feedback on all learning experiences completed through their dashboard. This is collected on their My Reports page which is also visible to administrators who can leave a review for the learner. If required, feedback can be given privately.\n\nThe system is capable of tracking the frequency of interactions a learner has with the resources as well as running semantic analyses on the quality of the learner\u2019s contribution., nan\nSurveys, Basic surveys can be created using the built in multiple choice question level gates. When a learning experience is completed the user will be prompted to provide a reflection. This provides four text fields for the user to give feedback on their experience and the time spent. The administrator is able to customise the questions asked via Stream\u2019s custom translation service, which allows changes to be made to terminology, for example renaming courses and descriptions. , nan\nAdding resources, Adding content to the LXP is quick and easy. Admins simply have to click \u2018New Resource\u2019 and select what format the learning is in. As you can see, Shttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1lSD7BjM0elSYsGeIQiQaDwd767rcjmeOas well as Scorm / xAPI content., nan\nContent types , Stream LXP supports numerous types of resources for use in Learning Experiences. Video, audio and media files can be uploaded directly as resources, as well as streamed from the internet. Files such as PDFs, .docs, etc can be uploaded alongside SCORM and xAPI content. Stream also supports LTI 1.1 content. Stream LXP includes an in-platform, rapid authoring tool that creates fully xAPI compliant, mobile optimised, media rich, and interactive content via a WYSIWYG editor.   \n\nThe following file types can be uploaded: \n\n.doc .docx\n.xls .xlsx\n.ppt .pptx\n.pdf\n.jpg\n.gif\n.png\n.mp4\n.m4v\n.zip (containing HTML files and other supported formats as output from Storyline, Adapt, etc.)\n.mp3 , nan\nContent Management, Stream has a built-in Resource Library that supports a wide range of content types including Adapt, Storyline, xAPI content, SCORM, LTI, video files, Youtube, Vimeo, HTML, Markdown, PDF, audio, etc. \n\nThis includes unlimited storage, a search function based on Resource name, as well as filtering based on content type and ownership. \n\nStream includes an in-platform rapid content WYSIWYG editing tool that creates attractive, media rich, mobile optimised, xAPI compliant content including multiple-choice questions, text blocks, video, images, text-on-images, checklists, and more. , nan\nLeaderboard points , XP (experience) points can be assigned to activities such as watching a video and/or taking part in a discussion. There are leaderboards based on points, XP, contribution, comments, object views and object votes., nan\nCertification & Re-Certification (Compliance), Using Stream\u2019s native recurrence and re-completion functionality, completions can be set to expire on a specific date or a number of days since completion e.g. 365 days.\nIf required, the learner\u2019s progress on the Learning Experience can be reset, and they are re-enrolled ready for re-completion. Admins, Team Managers and Users can all see reports related to most recent and previous completed attempts. , nan\nSelf-enrolment , Stream allows users to self-enrol onto courses., nan\nBadges, Learners can earn badges that can be displayed on their profile. Badges require achievement of certain conditions or combination of conditions to be rewarded such as a course, another badge, making a number of comments, receiving a number of votesand more. Badges are allow for multiple paths of completion, allowing users alternative methods to earn a badge.\nStreamLXP Badges are open badges and can be synched to a learner's Badgr Backpack (the replacement for Mozilla Backpack) from their profile. From Badgr they can then be shared anywhere that allows the sharing of open badges, such as LinkedIn., nan\nBadges and Certifications, Badges - Badges are a great way of awarding learners for achieving a level of skill, learning or experience, with the badge becoming a digital representation of that achievement. Within Learning Pool Stream\u2019s Admin area, badges can be created and added to Learning Experiences within the organization., nan\nEase of use, Stream LXP has been specifically designed to be easy to use and provide an intuitive user experience, minimising the number of clicks required to find content. Stream presents the learner\u2019s accessible content as a dashboard of scrollable tiles of learning experiences available to the learner with a pop out sidebar to display detailed information.\n, nan\nUser interface, As an innovative, future focused and feature rich solution, Stream is designed to offer a first-class learning experience within a modern, \u2018Netflix\u2019 style user interface. Stream enables both self-directed and structured learning pathways that deliver personal and social learning at any scale, from bite-sized content to multi-level courses alongside content curated from external sources. Utilising deep search and our chatbot, Flo, Stream enables true learning in the flow of work., nan\nReporting , Managers are able to see their team\u2019s learning records at a glance. Stream\u2019s built in report page provides an overview of learner activity, showing their progress through Learning Experiences. For course type Learning Experiences detailed reporting is displayed in the admin area, with information on which resources the learner has engaged with on a course. Using Learning Locker\u2019s Shareable Dashboard feature a set of reporting visualisations can be created for groups of learners, showing the level of engagement in different activities and a \u201cjourney\u201d visualisation of overall progress which can track completion across multiple separate activities, including other systems as long as relevant xAPI statements are being sent to Learning Locker. Reports are available to learners via the user menu, and optional Weekly Digest emails can be sent every week. Learners can see, at a glance, their current and archived Focus Areas. Within each Focus Area they can see the Learning Experiences that have completed. Learners can also see reviews/reports from their manager/trainer., nan\nAccessibility , We are actively working with the Digital Accessibility Centre (http://www.digitalaccessibilitycentre.org) to ensure our platforms are WCAG AA compliant. We are currently implementing their recommendations. Once development is complete they will review again to verify., nan\nAdministration , Stream\u2019s administration area provides a balance between ease of use and advanced functionality. A single page form with the most relevant settings lets you quickly create a new Learning Experience using your own content both using resources you upload or can access online., nan\nGamification , Gamification is one of Stream's core strengths. The platform is fully gamified throughout, including leaderboards and badges. Gamification features include XP (experience) points can be assigned to activities such as watching a video and/or taking part in a discussion. There are leaderboards based on points, XP, contribution, comments, object views and object votes. Badging rules can be set up using data from the LXP or the LRS. This allows for badge requirements to be recorded from any system within the learning ecosystem, including third party platforms. The actual awarding of badges is handled using services such as Open Badge or Credly. Badges can be displayed in a learner\u2019s profile., nan\nGamification, Research indicates that the application of gamification principles within an e-learning platform can significantly improve user engagement. Gamification plays a significant role in our Stream LXP, which was built with user engagement in mind. \n\nPoints - Points can be attributed to both the action of passively accessing some learning content [i.e. reading an article or, watching a video] and also, actively participating by engaging in discussion or uploading a resource of their own.\n\nLevels - Stream takes a cue from games that enable the player to \u2018level up\u2019 when a certain number of points have been earned. In a game, \u2018levelling up\u2019 often unlocks new abilities or areas of content. In Stream, by achieving a target points goal, users will typically unlock a new set of Learning Content, ready to be explored by the learner.\n\nLeaderboards - Competition is often a healthy additional motivator, and Stream LXP has a few leaderboard options for an array of learning behaviours - points, XP, contribution, comments, object views and object votes. \n\nBadges - Badges are a great way of awarding learners for achieving a level of skill, learning or experience, with the badge becoming a digital representation of that achievement. Within Learning Pool Stream\u2019s Admin area, badges can be created and added to Learning Experiences within the organization. Badging rules can be set up using data from the LXP or the LRS. This allows for badge requirements to be recorded from any system within the learning ecosystem, including third party platforms. The actual awarding of badges is handled using services such as Open Badge or Credly. Badges can be displayed in a learner\u2019s profile.\n, nan\nLearning pathways , Administrators can set up playlists of content that can be open for learners to add to their personal dashboard or configured to be automatically assigned to all members of a group. The Learning Experiences in playlists can contain a blend of learning activities, covering content within Stream or elsewhere. External content and activities can easily be linked in Stream and will be presented from within the platform where possible.\n\nAll assigned playlists will be shown on a learner\u2019s dashboard. Automatically populated streams for available courses and new learning experiences can also be enabled., nan\nBlended learning , Playlists and collaborative courses make blended learning easy to deliver using Stream. As a collection of learning experiences these can contain goals that can be achieved inside or away from the platform. A learning experience could be a job shadow, e-learning, YouTube video or numerous other types of activity. Each learning experience is tracked, as is overall progress through the course.\n\nLinear playlists allow you to define the order that LXs should be accessed, locking access to LXs until the learner has completed a prerequisite if required. \n\nAdministrators can also create multi-level courses, which can include a number of different LXs. , nan\nInbuilt authoring tool , Our Rapids authoring tool provides Stream with a simple, inbuilt content creation tool, allowing you to create one page pieces of content that could be used for: Micro-learning, Blogs and Video playlists. Rapids allows users to create content quickly and easily that can be made available on the LXP, with xAPI tracking enabled by default. All published content will be HTML pages built on the AMP framework ensuring that load times are minimal for all users across all devices. All editing is done inline with a WYSIWYG editor, so that you know exactly how your content will look whilst you are creating it. Once launched it will come with the following interactions available for use: Text, Images, Video (YouTube, Vimeo and Brightcove), MCQ, Checklists and Free text., nan\nCertificates, All Stream Learning Experiences can be configured to generate a downloadable PDF certificate using a template of your choice which is surfaced to the user automatically at the moment of completion. This includes formatting options to ensure text such as the learner name, Learning Experience name, date of completion, and date of completion expiry is in the correct place on the certificate. \nPDF certificates can be awarded and are visible in Stream, they can also be included in xAPI statements and exported to other platforms where necessary., nan\nPrequisites, Linear playlists allow you to set prerequisites, so that learners have to complete one LX before moving onto the next one or more complex multi-level courses can be developed with \u2018gates\u2019 that must be progressed through before further content unlocks., nan\nUser profile / dashboard, Our Learning Experience Platform is designed around a home dashboard for the learner which collects all their courses and learning experiences. These are presented in Netflix-style \u201cstreams\u201d of cards. Every user has a personal My Plan stream that they can add and remove learning experiences from. Users also have a user profile page that they can edit including adding an avatar and including biographical information. , nan\nHelp functionality , We don't have this specific functionality for direct contact, however this could be achieved by using the 'Sections' service which puts a link in the avatar menu to a page on the platform, which could include a mailto link with an email address. Alternatively, you could use the custom footer functionality to put the link there. (This would be additional cost), nan\nAssigned learning , The assigned Learning Stream surfaces Learning Experiences that the learner is enrolled on by the organization. This allows immediate access to learning that the organization wants the learner to complete. Users can also be added to groups which can assign Learning Experiences and Focus Areas if required. The group admin will also be able to assign learning to the group as a whole or to individuals within that group., nan\nRecord of Learning , Reports are available to learners via the user menu, and optional Weekly Digest emails can be sent every week. Learners can see, at a glance, their current and archived Focus Areas. Within each Focus Area they can see the Learning Experiences that have completed. Learners can also see reviews/reports from their manager/trainer. Reports can be exported by the user., nan\nPersonalised homepage, The homepage of Stream LXP for users is personalised by the content they see, are interested in or enrolled on. You will have the ability to ensure colours and banner imagery is on-brand for them.\n\nIn addition, different groups of users / populations can see their own recommended / suggested content to personalise it further., nan\nBranding, Our Stream LXP is fully multi-tenant and allows you to create child organisations, each being a logically separate instance. Each organisation has its own URL, its own users, its own branding and its own content.\n\nThe card header background, header accent and button background can all have their colours altered within the platform giving it a look and feel that will match your company colours.\n\n, nan\nOffline learning , PDF, files, documents etc can be downloaded from the site when it is online, however there is no provision for the download and sync of elearning whilst offline., nan\nDynamic groups , Stream can be configured to automatically and dynamically add and remove group membership for individual users. Dynamic Group rules include a wide variety of criteria including but not limited to: \nProfile data, including but not limited to\nLength of service\nLocation\nSeniority\nStart date\nPosition\nCareer field\nService branch\nManager role\nOrganisational hierarchy level\nLearning completions\nLearning Experiences \nBadges\nCertificates\nLearning enrolments\nPlatform permissions\nSkills & levels, ambitions / goals\nMembership of other groups\nOnce a member of a Dynamic Group, Stream LXP can provide direct enrolments and also targeted, relevant recommendations for users. This can also be used to restrict access to specific learning content via search., nan\nRecommendations , The LXP can recommend content to learners based on the completion of content including courses and via the criteria of Dynamic Group membership. Stream administrators can use profile, professional, skill, level, and learning history information to  dynamically control group membership. This groups similar users together and then provides targeted enrollments and recommendations based upon group membership. \n\nStream LXP has adopted a strategy of using Dynamic Groups and configurable criteria to group similar users together, rather than relying upon machine learning. This allows for more targeted and effective tailoring of learner pathways, enrollments, and recommendations based upon their organisation\u2019s specific content, objectives, and requirements. \nDynamic Groups does not require a minimum number of users to be effective. , nan\nRecommended Training, Stream personalizes the on-demand learning experience, using advanced analytics to recommend the best content, in the flow of work\nA learner\u2019s dashboard will be automatically populated by their group membership. In our upcoming feature, Dynamic Groups, learners can be automatically assigned to groups based on additional user profile fields.\nOur recommendation engine is designed to ensure that each user\u2019s experience will be unique. Following a short initial orientation, Stream personalizes the learner\u2019s homepage to highlight content or activities relevant to them. Rather than bombarding with lots of options, we use feedback on how relevant our suggestions are to create better recommendations over time.\nWe are currently finalising an onboarding process which allows you to capture more detailed information from learners. When a learner logs in, they are asked a series of questions about their current role and learning goals. This data is then analyzed by Stream\u2019s recommendation engine which surfaces recommendations to the learner based on their responses. You can also use our automation tool, Stream Automation, to trigger learning campaigns based on a learner\u2019s responses., nan\nNotifications, Stream LXP\u2019s automation tool provides out of the box and custom notifications to learners based on triggers from the LRS. Stream will also have increased in platform notifications scheduled for release in 2022., nan\nNotifications, Given our foundation in data, we get to know \u2018what works\u2019 in the learning context. We can then use that data to be proactive in improving learning outcomes using tools like Stream Automation, our automation tool (indluded in our Stream Enterprise suite). \n\nStream Automation lets you create campaigns to maximize learning impact within your organization, giving you complete control over the delivery of learning experiences. Complete an easy one-time set-up process and Stream Automation will personalize your individual learners\u2019 journey based on their responses and engagement.\nEasy to use and automated - Stream Automation has an intuitive interface allowing administrators to quickly create learning campaigns. Integration with Learning Pool\u2019s Stream LXP and Learning Locker makes this process even easier.\n\nIn the workflow - Notifications can be sent to a learner\u2019s inbox, as can regular digests, and, if more detail or context is needed, single- click access quickly takes them to the content or activity. Learning can also be accessed via our bot for MS Teams or Slack.\nData driven - Progress through a Stream Automation campaign is driven by data-point triggers like 'completion' or 'access' or a waiting period and check for action. These campaigns can be fully branded and designed, including images and video options.\nEasy for you - Set paths up through a simple interface and they run automatically, sending emails, checking scores, sending learners on different paths, nudging them with reminders and positive reinforcements. This includes the ability to run automated escalation pathways.\nThere are also a variety of in-platform notifications where a response is required - for example, Manager Sign-off notifications and Comment notifications.\n\nIn-platform notifications right now:\nComments\n- Someone commented in an LX you are enrolled to (we plan to remove this)\n- Someone replied to your comment\nManager sign-off\n- Object ready for sign-off (sent to manager)\n- Object has been signed off (sent to learner)\n- Feedback note received (sent to either manager or learner depending on who sent it) \n\nWe have a large number of notifications on the list for accelerate and it is one of the first things we are doing.\n\nThere are very few automated email notifications apart from:\nComments\n- Someone commented in an LX you are enrolled to (we plan to remove this)\n- Someone replied to your comment, nan\nGroup content assigner, As a Group Content Assigner for a specific group:\r\nI can enrol users from the group onto LXs linked to the group.\r\nI can control \u2018Linked Courses\u2019 settings for LXs linked to the group.  \r\nI cannot see any details of any users NOT in my group.\r\nI cannot see any Learning Experiences in the Learning Experiences table that are NOT linked to the group.\r\nI cannot see the name of groups that I am NOT a Group Content Assigner for.\r\nI cannot see other groups in LX Reports.\r\nI cannot administer any other LX settings.\r\nNote: if I am also a Course Admin or Course Tutor for an LX not linked to the Group, then I would be able to link that LX to any group that I was a Group Content Assigner for., nan\nDiagnostic assessment , As part of the package we would include both our LRS and our campaign planning tool Stream Automation. You can use activities such as surveys and assessments to measure confidence or competency based on a learning activity. If the learner is deemed to be below the required level then this can be set as a trigger point in Stream Automation to push out additional learning materials. Once these have been completed, Stream Automation can then check for an improvement through another assessment. You can map out any number of campaigns and pathways based on the information that is being received from the learning platform., nan\nCoaching/mentoring Facilitation, Stream includes 1-2-1 in-platform feedback to enable communication in context between learner's and their coaches. This can be informal discussion, and/or include more formal 'sign-off'. \n\nStream does not currently have a native coach and learner matching system, but it is possible to facilitate this using existing functionality. Enhancing the coaching offering with Stream is a roadmap item.  , nan\nCollaborative Learning Groups, You can use Stream to bring existing learning programs to life, incorporating social elements that promote a culture of peer-to-peer learning. \nStream leads the LXP market when it comes to Social Learning. With a unique model designed to engage students in peer-to-peer learning from the outset, it facilitates conversation and discussion between learners, surfacing comments alongside the learning and asking them to access the applicability of theory to real life and conceptualize how they might put theory into practice.  This works particularly well in close knit communities. We have a range of unique reporting tools that allow you to visualize where learning conversations are really taking place. \nStream also gives learners the ability to quickly create and upload user generated content to share with their learning network, using their mobile phone or webcam as their camera and microphone. Learners can instantly record or upload video clips from their device for use in video submissions to their tutor or group discussion sessions. With the vast majority of learners able to provide video recording via their device or smartphone this presents a engaging method to have learners engage with a subject or practice an area such as their \u2018Elevator pitch\u2019. , nan\nKnowledge Management, Assessments can be created in two ways: either using Rapids, our inbuilt content publishing tool, or by using our external authoring tool, Stream Authoring (included with Stream Enterprise). For full assessments and passing scores we would recommend using Stream Authoring. Asessments built using Stream Authoring can provide question level feedback to learners. , nan\nContent Library, Our Stream learning suite includes our Stream Authoring tool as well as access to our complete Future Skills catalog of content, which covers 13 Future Skills topics which are vital to the development of individuals in every business over the coming years.\n\nFuture Skills helps consolidate the behaviours your organisation needs today and build the skills for tomorrow \n- Bite sized pieces of content \n- Mix of content and activity learning experiences \n- Learning Pool created content mixed with hand curated, high-quality resources\n- Wide variety of mediums including Adapt modules, video, animation, articles, PDFs and real life activities\n- Continually growing and changing content\n\nLearning Pool also offer a full suite of editable off the shelf e-learning modules that can be accessed through our platforms quickly and easily. \n\nWe\u2019re the world\u2019s largest provider of Adapt e-learning content, with a portfolio of off the shelf catalogues complete with over 700 customisable e-learning modules, that work seamlessly across multiple devices.\n\nThe topics we cover are the essential building blocks for every organisation; Leadership, Compliance and Foundation Skills, covering everything from People Management to Data Protection and Understanding Finance.\n\nWe also offer a range of sector specific content - Contact Centre, Financial Services, Health, Hospitality, Housing, Manufacturing, Public Sector, Retail, & Social care.\n\n- Fully editable \u2013 with Stream Authoring, meaning you can customise content yourself, for your own branding, language and style\n- Host your content anywhere \u2013 supports SCORM and xAPI\n- New Modules \u2013 added continuously year on year and included at no extra cost\n- High quality CPD-accredited content - with rich design and gamification mean learner engagement is built-in\n- Built with Subject Matter Experts \u2013 who help us produce our world-class libraries of learning that you can trust, straight off the shelf, nan\nContent Development, Stream gives learners the ability to quickly create and upload user generated content to share with their learning network, using their mobile phone or webcam as their camera and microphone.\nLearners can instantly record or upload video clips from their device for use in video submissions to their tutor or group discussion sessions. With the vast majority of learners able to provide video recording via their device or smartphone this presents a engaging method to have learners engage with a subject or practice an area such as their \u2018Elevator pitch\u2019. \n, nan\nLearning Assignments, The primary dashboard is the front door to learning and can present content in a variation of streams to the learners. One of these streams covers Mandatory learning listing the learning that they should complete. \n\nThe mandatory learning configuration can be applied to any learning experience in the LxP and an expected completion date can be set against the learning. All of the learning interaction is tracked within the LxP allowing some key reporting capabilities and also within the LRS so you can populate reports and view completion information.\n\nYou will also be able to use the Stream Automation campaign tool to target users with reminders or additional notifications covering completion or failure to complete specific learning items. , nan\nLearning Reviews/rating, Learners can provide a thumbs up or thumbs down rating for all learning experiences. These ratings are surfaced to other learners and also to administrators. Using our Stream Analytics BI tool, this can be analysed to enable content optimisation, often alongside social comment semantic analysis data.   \n\nLearners are prompted to reflect after completing every learning experience by answering questions that are surfaced as part of the completion flow. Learners can revisit this at any time to review their answers as well as the content itself. \nTutors can view these reflections and also provide reviews which are then surfaced to the learner. These are private between the learner and the tutor. Learners cannot see each others reflections or reviews. , nan\nSkills assessment, There are a range of solutions that Learning Pool can offer for skills assessment. \n\nThe Onboarding feature in STream LXP gives learners the ability to assess their own level and ambition against skills. Learners could also be assessed through formal assessments which are then used to enrol them on subsequent learning. \n\nDiagnostic assessments can be created using the Stream Authoring tool. As part of the package we would include both our LRS and our campaign planning tool Stream Automation. You can use activities such as surveys and assessments to measure confidence or competency based on a learning activity. If the learner is deemed to be below the required level then this can be set as a trigger point in Stream Automation to push out additional learning materials. Once these have been completed Stream Automation can then check for an improvement through another assessment. You can map out any number of campaigns and pathways based on the information that is being received from the learning platform.\n\nxAPI data output to Learning Locker provides question level reporting on assessments. , nan\nSkills, Stream includes a feature called \u2018Skills and Levels\u2019, which allow you to capture information from learners during the login process and set a number of skills and a series of levels, such as \u2018Beginner, Intermediate, Expert\u2019. Learners can be dynamically added to groups based upon their skills choices, ready for the assignment and recommendation of learning personalised to their choices. You can also use our automation tool, Stream Automation, to trigger learning campaigns based on a learner\u2019s responses to the skills onboarding.\n\nThe onboarding feature gives learners the ability to assess their own level and ambition against skills. Learners could also be assessed through formal assessments which are then used to enrol them on subsequent learning. \n\nxAPI data output to Learning Locker provides question level reporting on assessments. \n\nOur learning analytics business intelligence tool, Stream Analytics, can combine learner skill data within Stream or from external platforms, with all other data from Stream LXP (groups, frameworks, custom profile fields, enrolments, completions, etc.) and Learning Locker LRS (xAPI). Using your own Designer licences, or in conjunction with our expert data team, you can create the insightful metrics and visualisations that you need to understand the distribution of skills across your organisation. As well as correlations between learner performance and skills. \n\nWe have worked with multiple customers who look to identify what skills are in focus for both the organisation, or the individual. As part of the onboarding process, it is possible to task the learner with choosing the skills that they feel are most important to them in their role, and for their future development within the company. This data can then be fed into our Stream Analytics tool to provide a Skills Analysis dashboard and report, nan\nDoes your system support a custom skill taxonomy? Tagging?, Administrators can create Skills and associated levels of competency/proficiency for that skill, for example a Skill for Product Demo Delivery with levels of Basic, Advanced and Expert.\nThe created Skill can be associated with a learners account with Level as a measure of their competency/proficiency at that Skill. \n\nTags are available and can be created and assigned to learning content. These are then used to dive recommendations., nan\nPlease indicate if your solution incorporates artificial intelligence, and, if so, how, Social Intelligence Dashboard: The Social Intelligence Dashboard (SID) uses machine learning within our Learning Record Store, Learning Locker, to interrogate and score comments for engagement and sentiment. Engagement measures critical thought, sentiment measures if a comment is positive or negative.\n\nMeasuring engagement and sentiment allows us to measure the value of our courses. We can use this to identify subject matter experts or those that need help. We can also use it to measure our content, gaining feedback from our users without them having to fill out a survey.\n\nSID presents this information in visual graph format, making it easier for managers to understand the information and identify trends.\n\nSID uses NLP and general ML. The system was trained with > 10,000 expert-rated items\n\nRecommendations: Recommendations present learners with relevant content and learning experiences without the need for them to always search or browse a very large pool of potential learning. They use simple algorithmic system. A number of different factors inform an overall \u2018score\u2019  - including ratings\u2019.\n\nStream uses a combination of users\u2019 skills selections, user profile and role information, dynamic rules for groups, and an algorithmic recommendation engine to surface the right recommendations to the right learners at the right time. This provides Stream administrators with total control over the recommendations that are provided to each group of learners.\nAs learners can be members of many groups, Stream natively creates highly personalised learning journeys and recommendations based on the individual which can adapt over time as their skill choices, progress, completion, and user profile information change.\nOur exclusive campaign and automation tool is powered by aggregated xAPI data in the LRS which can be used to deepen the personalisation of adaptive learning campaigns including proactive interventions that take learners down different pathways as the Stream learning suite adapts to their engagement and performance.\n\nWe have found that our clients can satisfy the level of personalisation and dynamism that they need from the existing native functionality of the Stream learning suite. AI brings its own challenges around content permissions and visibility to the correct groups of learners, so we have chosen to enable administrators to create highly personal recommendations and learning journeys, with full control, and without the need for AI and machine learning., nan\nCMI5 support, We have implemented elements of CMI5 (and the xAPI spec by its very nature conforms to aspects of it). We don't implement the CMI5 launch spec, nor do we handle uploads of CMI5 packages, nan\nVirtual Reality (VR), Whilst Stream currently has no support for VR or AR learning experiences, our internal content development team and partners are able to develop standalone experiences that utilise these technologies. \n\nOur internal development team includes experienced 3D artists capable of creating assets and environments suitable for application in VR and AR experiences. We have previously applied these techniques in the development of a full 3D simulation for SGN gas engineers which involved the creation with a whole street of 3D interactive properties. \n\nWe have partnerships with a number of developers and organisations that help us take these 3D assets and environments and turn them into AR or VR experiences including the Movement.\n\nThe internal team are also able to use Articulate Storyline to create explorable 360 degree environments using 3D generated imagery, photography, video or combination of all three for a more cost-effective immersive solution.\n, nan\nCertification, Certification can either be permanent or only last for a period of times e.g. First Aid Certification that only lasts for 12 months. After this, the user can be enrolled onto the same learning experience (progress is reset), or a different learning experience / playlist. Stream supports recompletion windows to allow access to retake the learning before the expiry of their current completion. Email and in-platform notifications will be triggered by various events within the certification process. Our campaign automation tool can also be used to create personalised, automated email notifications using complex and entirely workflows that suit your organisation and designed through an intuitive user interface. , nan\nEcommerce, Stream supports card payments using Stripe as the payment processor. Stripe accepts Visa, MasterCard and American Express credit and debit cards. Administrators can create \u2018Products\u2019 using courses on Stream LXP, which people must purchase to access. Vouchers for courses can also be generated and discount codes can be used.\n, nan\nCertification/credits, Stream LXP has recurrence and recompletion functionality built in as a native feature which can be used within all learning experiences. This enables the learner\u2019s completions to expire after a period of time, at which point they can be re-enrolled and their progress reset so that they can retake and re-complete the learning. All current and previous attempts and completions are tracked for reporting by admins, the learners, and their managers. \nCredit based learning can be tracked using Stream\u2019s badge functionality. Badges can be configured with specific criteria including completions, posting comments, comment votes, and completing other badges. These can be simple criteria, or complex paths, creating an extensible and flexible credit tracking system. , nan\nCalendar, Stream LXP doesn't include a calendar display in the traditional way, instead the Learner Dashboard is organised by upcoming date order and the learner can access all information about that event via the Learning Experience that contains the Event. There is also an iCal integration available for Events. Additional or reminder information can also be sent directly from the platform, or via our Campaign tool., nan\nMultiple training types for each curriculum\nA curriculum or course can contain more than one training type i.e. classroom training, e-learning, SCORM, on-the-job, assessments, checklists, Microsoft documents, surveys, tests, etc.\n\n, Stream is specifically designed to facilitate courses and curriculums that are composed of different types and modes of learning. There are over 40 \u2018Learning Experience\u2019 (LX) types available, and these can be combined into either multi-level, multi-object courses or playlists. All LX types can also stand alone. The interface for course builders makes it easy to upload any media type (including SCORM)- or link - or set a task for things like User Generated Content uploads. Content can also be created easily  in the system using the built-in rapid authoring and publishing tool (including OTJ tasks and checklists) - or more complex elearning, surveys and assessments can be created using Adapt (our full capability authoring tool) and added to courses. Social commenting can also be added to any course type or LX, as can \u2018Manager Sign Off\u2019 capabilities.Classroom training events can also be created and managed in Stream via \u2018Venue\u2019 and these can be added to training programs  - stand alone, or combined with other types of learning in blended programs.\n, nan\nMobile app, All functionality within the platform is available across all devices offering a consistent and user friendly approach. It is tested for compatibility with modern web browsers and requires no plugins or software. The system adapts to the device for optimal viewing whilst not losing any of its functionality.\n\nOur mobile app is available from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store. The LXP mobile app is an offline player that allows users to take their learning offline and on the go, by using the app to download and view modules. This will be particularly advantageous to those where internet bandwidth is an issue. Course progress is saved and sent back to the LXP.\n\nThe mobile app will provide the following functionality:\nA native mobile device app that works on iOS and Android operating systems\nCan download Adapt xAPI content to your device for offline viewing adn completion in \u2018My Library\u2019\nAutomatically syncs xAPI progress when back online\nUsers can choose whether this is via wi-fi only or via cellular data\nFull access to normal Stream mobile user experience via the app\nNo admin access via the app\n, nan\nManager Sign-Off, Stream\u2019s extensive Manager Sign-off functionality allows managers to view Team Member responses to on the job training Resources such as checklists, text entry, and multiple choice questions. Managers can provide feedback in the form of direct one-to-one notes via the platform, and also sign-off the OJT when they are ready and satisfied. The image below shows where a manager would be able to sign off on a submission by a team member.\n\nStream\u2019s user generated content Resource type allows learners to submit documents, links, images and record/upload videos directly through the front-end within the learning object. These submissions are automatically stored within the Resource Library for review by Tutors and Administrators. If required, the submissions can be used within other Learning Experience objects, for example as best practice examples to be shared with the cohort. \n\nWe are working on extending the Manager Sign-off functionality to allow managers to view Team Member submissions ready for feedback and sign-off., nan\nLearning Plans, Administrators can assign courses, multiple courses and playlists to users either directly or dynamically. For example, our largest LXP customer YUM! Brands assign learning to their users to provide a \u2018curriculum\u2019, using a mix of courses and playlists. \n\nThe assigned Learning Stream surfaces Learning Experiences that the learner is enrolled on by the organization. This allows immediate access to learning that the organization wants the learner to complete. Users can also be added to groups which can assign Learning Experiences and Playlists if required. The group admin will also be able to assign learning to the group as a whole or to individuals within that group.\n, nan\nAccount merge - Merge two or more profiles belonging to the same learner into one. This is necessary when there duplicated IDs for the same user., Account merge is not possible in Stream LXP. However, you can input historical records. One of our large LXP clients add historic records to the new ID, rather than merging.  , nan", "doc_id": "ee345784-a269-4fbb-b5d0-44260cd2310e", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "__type__": "Document"}, "2d218ff0-8480-44b5-b700-a4b26d405f74": {"text": "Do you have an app?, We provide an iOS and Android application through the relevant app stores. This allows learners Full access to normal Stream mobile user experience and the ability to download Adapt content for offline completion which can be syncronized later when the learner is online.\n\nStream is a web-based solution with a responsive design that scales to both computer and mobile devices such as tablets and mobile phones. It is tested for compatibility with modern web browsers and requires no plugins or software. We do not require the use of an application, users can access Stream from any device that provides a modern web browser. The system adapts to the device for optimal viewing whilst not losing any of its functionality. , The app is not branded to the customer but will reflect their organisations branding when logged in.\nIt is crucial to note that the app does not support SSO based login - which renders it unusable for many large organisations\nWe can potentially create a branded application (whitelabel) specifically for a customer but this involves additional cost.\nMobile app, All functionality within the platform is available across all devices offering a consistent and user friendly approach. It is tested for compatibility with modern web browsers and requires no plugins or software. The system adapts to the device for optimal viewing whilst not losing any of its functionality.\n\nWe have just delivered our mobile app, which will be available from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.\n\nThe LMS mobile app is an offline player that allows users to take their learning offline and on the go, by using the app to download and view modules. This will be particularly advantageous to those where internet bandwidth is an issue. Course progress is saved and sent back to the LMS.\n\nThe mobile app will provide the following functionality:\nA native mobile device app that works on iOS and Android operating systems\nCan download Adapt xAPI content to your device for offline viewing adn completion in \u2018My Library\u2019\nAutomatically syncs xAPI progress when back online\nUsers can choose whether this is via wi-fi only or via cellular data\nFull access to normal Stream mobile user experience via the app\nNo admin access via the app, nan\nBrowsers, Stream is available from any device with a modern web browser and internet connection. There are no additional costs. The platform uses TLS 1.2 for HTTPS connections, this is common to modern web browsers.\n, nan\nAccess control , Access Controls can be applied in two ways. 1. access to an organisation (for example, only your personnel would have access to the parent site and customer admins just their own site) 2. within an organisation there are various roles that limit permissions by group and course. For example: -- a Group Admin for a specific group within the child site can view progress for any members of their group, view and moderate courses that are linked to their group and add or delete group users. -- a Group Tutor role can just view progress and moderate contributions for a given group across courses. -- a Course Admin will be able to administrate courses for which they are listed as a \u2018Course Admin\u2019. They cannot see or edit other courses. -- a Course Tutor can view progress of users and moderate contributions for courses they are listed as a 'Course Tutor', but cannot edit or manage course content., nan\nCustom Roles, Custom roles can be created within your organization instance upon request. , Custom Roles are not something we hand out to everyone. It's a very manual process and there should not be an expectation of this being a simple easy setup. It's just not.\r\n\r\nNo customers are currently using Custom Roles, but Yum are expected to start using them at some point once we fix some issues with the granularity.\r\n\r\nI'd not mention them at all during RFPs unless an absolute must\nBranding, Firstly, at the start of the project, our designers would work with you to ensure that the look and feel of the solution adheres to your brand guidelines, and the way in which you would like information to be presented to your users. We find that the look and feel, navigation and user experience play a key part in user engagement with the solution. Therefore, we will ensure that we get this right for you.\n\nStream LXP also offers the ability to easily apply your own branding and make any desired changes, such as colours, logos, user icons, layouts and much more.\n\nLikewise, content built using the Stream Authoring tool can also be fully customised in line with your branding., nan\nMulti-tenancy (multiple domains), To approach multi-tenancy, Stream LXP provides the ability to create multiple Stream 'child' sites that would sit underneath a 'Parent' site. This allows you to have multiple sites, each with their own look, feel, branding, terminology, SSO, integrations etc allowing you to cater for individual requirements from one client audience to another whilst maintaining overall management and account control from the 'Parent' site.\n\nEach child tenant has independent data, allowing users, tenant settings, administration, branding, courses completions, reporting and other data to be separated but still remain within a structured organisation for administration.\n\nAn additional benefit of the way our Parent and Child sites are set up is that you are able to create 'Master' learning experiences in the Master site and the quickly and effortlessly duplicate those into your Child sites as you see fit, which can significantly decrease the time it takes for you to provide learning experiences to your audience., nan\nSSO, Stream can be integrated with SAML 2.0 and OAUTH based SSO systems. We frequently integrate with SSO IDPs and have provided instances with SSO only or mixed authorisation logins. \nSSO comes in 2 variations:\n1. Customer Implemented - used where the organisation already has an identity provider and is capable of managing the service. \n2. Learning Pool Implemented - Learning Pool have to setup and maintain the service year on year. \nLearning Pool will work with your IT security team to implement SSO.\n, nan\nMultiple SSO providers, Through an external provider, Overt. Overt would sit between the IDPs and the LXP, and then all the LXP will see is a single IDP. When a user accesses the LXP, we'd redirect to Overt, who would then give the user an option to login for the appropriate role.. \nWe will need to work with your IT team to understand your SSO and share some configuration information.\n, nan\nAPIs, \n\nYou will be able to use APIs to make changes to Stream from another system. We have a comprehensive API for users, groups, courses and enrolments. Publicly documented at https://apidocs.curatr3.com/, nan\nSelf-enrolment , Stream allows users to self-enrol onto courses., nan\nEase of use, Stream LXP has a task hierarchical layout making it easy to scan and quickly find key information including Search, Profile and Personalised learning. Tailored learning content is arranged into intuitive sections including Recently Viewed, MyPlan, New etc. The UI has been designed with affordances and chunking to make it seamless to navigate. Each piece of learning content has an information icon that provides a contextual peak into the learning content available before making a selection. The LXP provides frictionless access to our world class content to empower your learners., nan\nUser interface, As an innovative, future focused and feature rich solution, Stream is designed to offer a first-class learning experience within a modern, \u2018Netflix\u2019 style user interface. Stream enables both self-directed and structured learning pathways that deliver personal and social learning at any scale, from bite-sized content to multi-level courses alongside content curated from external sources. Utilising deep search and our chatbot, Flo, Stream enables true learning in the flow of work., nan\nInterface, Stream is a web-based solution with a responsive design that scales to both computer and mobile devices such as tablets and mobile phones. All functionality within the platform is available across all devices offering a consistent and user friendly approach. It is tested for compatibility with modern web browsers and requires no plugins or software. We do not require the use of an application, users can access Stream from any device that provides a modern web browser. The system adapts to the device for optimal viewing whilst not losing any of its functionality. \n\nWe are currently developing a mobile app with offline access, due to be released in the coming months. \n\nWe are currently working on delivering an offline player which will give users the ability to download learning packages and complete these whilst offline, This will be particularly advantageous to those where internet bandwidth is an issue. We are aiming to have this player in place by the end of 2021., nan\nAccessibility , We are actively working with the Digital Accessibility Centre (http://www.digitalaccessibilitycentre.org) to ensure our platforms are WCAG AA compliant. We are currently implementing their recommendations. Once development is complete they will review again to verify., nan\nAdministration , Stream\u2019s administration area provides a balance between ease of use and advanced functionality. A single page form with the most relevant settings lets you quickly create a new Learning Experience using your own content both using resources you upload or can access online., nan\nFile limit , Content is hosted on the LXP platform. A file limit of 250MB applies to every upload. We do not provide a cap but have a fair usage policy., nan\nScalability, Stream has been designed with the ability to scale to demand, so you can be confident that we\u2019ll be able to support your user numbers. Learning Pool are able to discuss flexible licensing terms where appropriate., nan\nAnders Pink integration, Learning Pool have collaborated with Anders Pink to create an integration between the two platforms. This integration puts Anders Pink articles straight onto learner\u2019s dashboards, increasing choice for your learners and driving engagement., nan\nInbuilt authoring tool , Our Rapids content authoring tool provides Stream with a simple, inbuilt content creation tool, allowing you to create one page pieces of content that could be used for: Micro-learning, Blogs and Video playlists.

All published content will be HTML pages built on the AMP framework ensuring that load times are minimal for all users across all devices. All editing is done inline with a WYSIWYG editor, so that you know exactly how your content will look whilst you are creating it. It comes with the following interactions available for use: Text, Images, Video (YouTube, Vimeo and Brightcove), MCQ, Checklists and Free text., nan\nDoes content open in browser and not in pop-up window? , Learning Experiences will open within the same browser. , nan\nStorage of sensitive information (age, gender etc.), Technically we are able to store all of this data, however we would like to avoid storing sensitive information such as gender on the platform wherever possible, for GDPR purposes. We would need to have a discussion with you about the requirement to get a better understanding of your reasons for providing this data for the purposes of the platform. We would need to ensure that both parties are meeting their GDPR commitments before implementing this. , nan\nHosting , Stream sites will be hosted through our hosting partner Amazon Web Services (AWS). The primary servers are located in London, with backup servers at AWS London Data Centre Disaster Recovery in Dublin., nan\nData export , Data can be exported in CSV format, nan\nHelp functionality , We don't have this specific functionality for direct contact, however this could be achieved by using the 'Sections' service which puts a link in the avatar menu to a page on the platform, which could include a mailto link with an email address. Alternatively, you could use the custom footer functionality to put the link there. (This would be additional cost), nan\nRelease frequency , We work in an agile way, so that when a new feature, improvement or bug fix is completed, it can be released as soon as it's ready. This means that there could be multiple releases in a day if necessary. Any functionality, UI, or feature changes are communicated in advance of release to clients., nan\nImplementation timeframe , The implementation typically takes around 9-12 week for Stream and Learning Locker, however this could extend to a few months, depending on the complexities and any 3rd party integrations required. However, a detailed project plan will be provided at the start of the project, outlining timelines and resource requirements., nan\nLanguages , The front-end user interface includes translations into 30+ languages. A default platform language can be set that can then be overriden by user preferences.\nMulti language support is available on course text fields, allowing for the text displayed to match the user's language.\nThe LXP does not provide subtitles or launch different content depending upon the user.\n\nStream supports the following languages: \nArabic, AR\nBulgarian, BG\nCambodian, KM\nChinese, Simplified, ZH\nChinese, Traditional, ZH-TW\nCroatian, HR\nCzech, CZ\nDanish, DA\nDutch, DE\nEnglish, EN_GB\nEnglish, EN\nEstonian, ET\nFinnish, FI\nFrench, Canadian, FR-CA\nFrench, European, FR\nGerman, DE\nGreek, EL\nHebrew, HE\nHindi, HI\nHungarian, HU\nIndonesian, ID\nItalian, IT\nJapanese, JP\nKorean, KO\nLatvian, LV\nLithuanian, LT\nMalaysian, MS\nNorwegian, NO\nPolish, PL\nPortuguese, Brazilian, PT-BR\nPortuguese, European, PT\nRomanian, RO\nRussian, RU\nSlovakian, SK\nSpanish, European, ES\nSpanish, Latin American, ES-LA\nSwedish, SV\nThai, TH\nTurkish, TR\nUkrainian, UK\nVietnamese, VI, nan\nChange Management, All code changes require review by other developers with appropriate experience. The changes require full unit and integration tests, before being passed to the QA team (who are an integral part of the planning procedure). They expand upon this with further automation tests and where required, manual testing. An annual penetration test is performed across the codebase on a dedicated stack.\nLarge releases may be deployed to a staging environment \n, nan\nCustomer managed SSL certificate, IF MUST HAVE REQUIREMENT CHECK WITH SYSADMINS\nFor standard SaaS, the we provide the certificate with Amazon as the Certificate Authority. This certificate is DNS validated.\nUnless they are getting separate infrastructure they will be using our domain., nan\nWhat differentiates your Learning Experience Platform (LxP) from a Learning Management Solution (LMS)? Differentiator, We\u2019re strong believers that learning software is built with a specific workflow in mind. The closer the software matches the workflow, the better the user experience. The LMS, as a concept, was built with an administrative workflow in mind. They make life easy for folks who need to assign specific training tasks to specific people. This used to be pretty much all there was in an online training experience. But much has changed. \n\nThe LMS, at its heart, fosters a \u2018telling\u2019 culture. That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a time and a place for being more direct in your learning experiences, there absolutely is. But that is not the \u2018default\u2019 of a learning culture. Learning cultures sustain self-development. The workflow that supports a learning culture is centered around the user and what they need to enhance their development. The need for AI and personalization talks to making the learner experience the best it can be, not the administrator. \n\nFor an LMS, any permutation on the expectation that the user is here to do an assigned training is most likely a user interface workaround, and those don\u2019t work well from a user experience point of view. Content can often be \u2018discovered\u2019, eventually, using an LMS, but it's not the workflow the original software was designed to solve, so it's clunky and unsatisfactory.\n\nWhy is Stream better?\n\nWe\u2019re built with a modern learning workflow in mind. This means flexing to both the pull and the push, without favoring one mode over the other. Whether it\u2019s assigning content to groups or individuals based on data, or allowing users to discover new content for themselves. Whether the content is a quick launch of a mandatory piece to maintain Fair, Safe and Legal operations, or if it\u2019s a long-haul, multi-level learning program, critical to the businesses success. \n\nIf we think about the big \u2018moments of L&D need\u2019, they each need a different workflow\u2026 a different user experience. \n\nOur focus is on delivering 4 key workflows:\n\nOnboarding (joining the company)\nOperating (mandatory training)\nPerforming (just-in-time, on the job help)\nTransitioning (reskilling, upskilling, big change projects, launching new products etc)\n\n\nWe can configure our suite to work with any of these 4 workflows, for any combination of users. \n, nan\nPlease provide a brief overview of your learning solution(s)., Our Stream Learning Experience Platform (LXP) learning suite will underpin the solution, providing a first-class learning experience within a simple, engaging interface that modern learners expect. Stream ships with our Learning Record Store as standard. Learning Locker allows you to aggregate data from multiple sources, automate the provision of data to other tools, and automate/trigger adaptive learning pathways and recommendations and nudges via our Waves automation tool (included with Stream Gold).\n\nWe have partnered with Sisense to bring the power of their world-class Business Intelligence (BI) tool, Learning Locker and Stream LXP together to provide you with valuable insights, automated sharing of dynamic reports and analytics, and full visualisation customisation. \n\nStream LXP is our most comprehensive learning suite, used by global companies to develop exceptional employees with remarkable efficiency. We\u2019ve brought together best-in-class components for everything you need to deliver learning at scale.\nOur technology is based on leading open standards that make life simple for everyone; learners, managers and administrators.\nOur LXP has the key features that you need, with a clean, easy-to-access, modern interface that learners want to engage with.  Stream is device agnostic and mobile friendly, making it easy for busy learners to access on the go.\n\nStream provides significant benefits including:\n- Integration of learning technology and learning content\n- Powerful learning analytics\n- A modern, intuitive user experience\n- Social and peer-group learning\n- An exciting roadmap of future developments\n\nStream enables your organisation to deliver on the promise of a true \u2018learning culture\u2019 by delivering learning experiences that drive the behaviours needed today whilst building the skills that are needed to succeed tomorrow. \nIt does this by being simple, smart and social...\n\nStream is simple\nOverwhelmed, time poor learners want mandatory learning experiences done with a minimum of fuss and need self-development opportunities highlighting quickly and easily. Stream allows you to build intuitive learning pathways for your users, making the user experience simple and straightforward. \nStream\u2019s inbuilt content creation tool, Rapids, allows you to quickly and easily create and publish simple and effective xAPI content. With inline editing, multiple layout options and a range of widgets, you will be able to get your content directly to your learners in no time\nUsing the \u201cGoogle grade search\u201d, users can easily find and launch learning experiences which might be buried deep inside your learning content. Consuming bite-sized experiences has never been easier or more convenient, allowing learners to fit both assigned and self-directed learning into the flow of work. \n\nStream is smart\nThe competition for attention is extremely high; in order to get into focus we need to be present in the workflow and to be clever enough to make relevant recommendations to learners. Our recommendation engine is designed to enhance the user experience so each experience will be unique. Following a short initial orientation, Stream personalizes the learner\u2019s homepage to highlight content or activities relevant to them. Rather than bombarding with lots of options, we use feedback on how relevant our suggestions are to create and offer better recommendations over time.\nStream\u2019s new Onboarding feature (coming Autumn 2021) allows you to capture more detailed information from learners during the login process, triggering recommendations and giving the learner a targeted, personalised experience. \n\nStream is xAPI compliant so you can easily use Learning Locker LRS to aggregate data across your other business systems and prove the value of learning in your organization. Every user action is tracked, giving you an unparalleled ability to refine your content and link learning activity to staff performance. Waves can use this data to surface reminders and nudge users to complete actions and encourage them to return to the platform regularly when they need to. \n\nOur range of unique reporting tools allow you to visualise where change is really taking place across the organisation. The only tool of its kind, the Social Intelligence Dashboard (SID) is a proprietary method for judging the efficacy of online learning. SID provides insights into the quality of learner comments throughout a Stream Learning Experience in terms of sentiment and engagement, displaying data from both Semantic and Sentiment Analysis. \n\nOur artificial intelligence powered bot, \u2018Flo\u2019, searches directly into your learning content and delivers answers back to the learner within their working day, integrating with Microsoft Teams, Slack and Facebook Workplace.  \n\nStream is social\nThe skills that we need more of today, and won\u2019t be replaced by machines tomorrow, are all about people. And people learn from people. Stream incorporates social elements that promote a culture of peer-to-peer learning. Stream social courses provoke meaningful discussions and take cohorts on a community driven learning experience. Any content on Stream can be used to promote conversation, turning your learning platform into your company watercooler.\nStream also gives learners the ability to quickly create and upload user generated content to share with their learning network, using their mobile phone or webcam as their camera and microphone., nan\nPlease explain your experience related to LxP & LMS (# of years, industries served), Learning Pool was founded in 2006 to bring online learning into organisations in a collaborative way. Originally focused on sharing online learning content amongst government bodies, we took that concept and built out the offer to enable performance improvement and modernisation. We\u2019ve always had a healthy obsession with delivering value for money which led us to engage strongly in open source projects that deliver real benefit outside of Learning Pool and provide leading-edge innovation at a reasonable price. For example, Learning Locker is the world\u2019s only xAPI compliant, open source Learning Record Store and we\u2019re a founding member of the Adapt open source framework that brought responsive elearning to the whole industry. \n\nWe pride ourselves in being thought leaders and innovators in the industry.  This has been recognised with the Queen's Award for Innovation: https://learningpool.com/duke-gloucester-visits-oxford-office-commemoration-learning-locker-queens-awards-win/. With 14 years of experience and over 500 learning platform clients we have a wealth of experience to best understand your basic and extensive requirements and provide a solution that will work for both you and your learners. \n\nStream in its current form has been available since October 2019, however the technology has been available for over 12 years when including our Curatr solution. In 2019 we acquired the Oxfordshire based learning innovations company, HT2 Labs and its market leading products, combining a culture of innovation and a passion for doing what\u2019s right for the L&D community and the clients we serve. As HT2 Labs merged with Learning Pool, their award-winning Learning Experience Platform, Curatr integrated Learning Pool\u2019s own LXP, Stream. Combining the tech in both platforms, Learning Pool then relaunched the rebranded, Stream LXP. With the best in personalized and social learning, first-class authoring, curated content and a range of tools to enable learning in the flow of work, HT2 Labs and Learning Pool together were able to create a market-leading product, a genuine Learning Experience Platform that is now being used by more than 100 organizations including Yum, Amazon, IOC, Fifa, IRobot, Valvoline and INL.\n\nLearning Pool's LMS is trusted by more than 530 brands across the globe. Over the last fourteen years we have worked with over 800 organizations around the world to deliver a complete online learning solution that drives performance and generates demonstrable strategic and commercial results. Embedding a learning culture can be a challenge in any organization, however our Learning Management System helps you deliver outstanding results. We work with organisations such as FIFA, Domestic & General, A.G. Barr, Wateraid, Volkswagen Financial Services, Atlas Hotels, and Berlitz. \n, nan\nConfigurable, Stream includes a wide range of configuration options including branding, theme, and dashboard layout. All language strings within the platform can be edited to suit your organisation's 'vocabulary'. This includes translations across 41 languages. Stream can accommodate a custom footer which is surfaced at the bottom of every page. \n\nAll learning delivery functionality is designed to be highly flexible and extensible to allow administrators to create user experiences and learner journeys that suit their learners. These can be personalised based upon user attributes, learner progress, skills, and levels using dynmic rules for groups.  \n\nIt is not currently possible to personalise the look and feel of the platform per user or group of users at this time, but this is a roadmap item. , nan\nCustomisation, Our Stream LXP is fully multi-tenant and allows you to create child organisations, each being a logically separate instance. Each organisation has its own URL, its own users, its own branding and its own content.\n\nThe card header background, header accent and button background can all have their colours altered within the platform giving it a look and feel that will match your company colours., nan\nTheme, Every Stream LXP customer is provided with a branded theme as standard., nan\n , No support dependencies, nan\nPlease describe your experience in global deployments, In 2019 we acquired the Oxfordshire based learning innovations company, HT2 Labs and its market leading products, combining a culture of innovation and a passion for doing what\u2019s right for the L&D community and the clients we serve. As HT2 Labs merged with Learning Pool, their award-winning Learning Experience Platform, Curatr integrated Learning Pool\u2019s own LXP, Stream.

Over the last 4 years we've delivered over 50 content projects and come up with innovative technical solutions to convert large volumes (50+ modules) into our Adapt Builder format.\nAmway have recently subscribed to Stream LXP, which includes our LRS, Learning Locker, Waves and Flo chatbot. Their aims are to make learning more accessible and to generate richer data and insights for the business. The next stage is to feed data from their people management system into Learning Locker, to correlate any variance in learning outcomes with learner behaviours in different populations across their audience. Learning Pool (the only learning supplier) were invited to Amway Globals\u2019 content strategy meeting, to consult on how to best meet their learning needs in 2021. \nWe\u2019re excited to able to not only be able to provide insight to Amway but the innovative products and services to deliver training and enable their team for the future.\n\n\nYUM! Brands\nLearning Pool is working with an Enterprise Global Organization, with multiple divisions, brands and almost 1 million employees. This relationship began with a small instance of Learning Locker LRS. Our expertise and support on that project laid the foundation for trust and collaboration across their entire ecosystem. Learning Pool was invited to present our entire suite of products and services, specifically Stream LXP. This organization selected us to be their trusted partner in this journey to recreate their learning ecosystem, taking advantage of the wide range of platforms and services that we can provide, but also our openness to integrate other tools that were essential to their business.\n\nToday the client is seeing the fruition of their decision come true; we have innovated in record time with our products to meet their key business objectives. Because of the openness of our platforms, specifically Learning Locker and Stream, we are so much more to them than just a system or vendor that provides a tool, but rather a partner who shares in the challenges of delivering knowledge to their workforce. \n\nInternation Olympic Committee - Athlete365 \nEarlier this year we successfully launched the IOC's Athlete365 learning into their complex digital ecosystem of platforms. Athlete365 is tasked with helping to improve the lives of Athletes and their Entourage through online learning and as such it has a global reach which meant numerous considerations from multiple languages to the wide variety of hardware and bandwidth considerations across different countries. We also worked closely with the other partners who provide their ecosystem such as their main website develpers, their SSO providers and a variety of content production and design agencies. Following on from the success of Athlete365 we have recently started working on two further projects with the IOC. 1. Athlete Mental Health - this falls  under the Athlete365 banner but has a specific focus and different delivery mechanisms 2. Games Learning - this is for the people who put on the games in the hosting countries to ensure they are well prepared and have all the training and learning they need to ensure the successful management and delivery of the olympic games.\n\n, nan\nDoes the system allow for the creation/update of business rules (customer-created rules that do not require vendor interaction)? , Dynamic Rules for Groups\nWhat it is:\n\u25cf Stream\u2019s existing Groups functionality has been significantly improved. As an org administrator, you can now create a set of rules that go way beyond the existing tagging system in Stream.\n\u25cf Group membership can now be fully dynamic and based upon an array of different criteria including completions, enrollments, profile data, language, admin roles, custom profile field values, and in the near future, job roles, skills, and levels.\nWhy we have done this:\n\u25cf Just like Custom Profile Fields, the new dynamic rules in Stream Groups revolutionise automation and control for Stream org administrators.\n\u25cf Not only will this save time, but also provides real opportunities for dynamic learning journeys based on enrollments and recommendations and fine control visibility of learning between different groups.\n\u25cf By moving users out of one group and into another, you can provide conditional pathways of learning that are adaptive to a learner\u2019s profile, performance, choices, and needs.\nHow it works:\n\u25cf Every new and existing Group now has a \u2018Dynamic Rules\u2019 page.\n\u25cf Using \u2018AND OR\u2019 logic between rules and sets of rules, you can configure conditions and filters as simply or as complex as you require. You can also use membership of one group as a condition for membership in another.\n\u25cf You can create a draft set of rules ready for when you need to enable the group.\n\u25cf Rules are processed automatically every 20 minutes or so. When you publish your rules, they are run once immediately. Some complex rules can take a few minutes to process fully, so you may not see results in the \u2018Members\u2019 list straight away., nan\nAdaptive Learning, Stream can capture skill and level information about a user in a number of ways. This can be via the purpose built onboarding process where the learner self-selects, via API integration with a third-party skills assessment / management tool, via data-in (e.g. HRIS), or via manual administrator intervention. Skills data can then be used to drive dynamic group membership which in turn controls enrolments and recommendations, as well as \n\nThe data we aggregate through Learning Locker LRS from various sources within your L&D ecosystem can power recommendation and adaptive learning tools, like our own Waves campaign tool and Learning Locker's semantic analysis engine.\n\nOur exclusive campaign and automation tool, Waves, is powered by aggregated data in the LRS. You can use Waves to create adaptive learning campaigns - proactive interventions that take learners down different pathways as we adapt to their engagement and performance.\n\nOur semantic analysis engine uses machine learning within Learning Locker LRS, to interrogate and score comments for engagement and sentiment. Engagement measures critical thought, sentiment measures if a comment is positive or negative.\n\nMeasuring engagement and sentiment allows us to measure the value of our courses. We can use this to identify subject matter experts or those that need help. We can also use it to measure our content, gaining feedback from our users without them having to fill out a survey. This data is presented in visual graph format within Stream LXP's social intelligence dashboard, making it easier for managers to understand the information and identify trends.\n\nRecommendations within Stream LXP present learners with relevant content and learning experiences without the need for them to always search or browse a very large pool of potential learning. They use simple algorithmic system. A number of different factors inform an overall \u2018score\u2019  - including ratings\u2019., nan\nWCAG AA, Partially compliant. We are actively working with the Digital Accessibility Centre (http://www.digitalaccessibilitycentre.org) to ensure our platforms are WCAG AA compliant. We are currently implementing their recommendations, once development is complete they will review again to verify. We maintain an accessibility statement: https://learningpool.com/accessibility-statement-for-learning-pool-stream-lxp/, nan\nSection 508, We will be undertaking VPAT for Section 508 alongside our current auditing for WCAG 2.1 AA going forwards., Check with Ben Jones if required.\nConcurrent Users, Our solution is highly scalable and able to support large numbers of users. We will provision with appropriate hardware based upon your user count. There is no arbitrary limit on numbers of possible concurrent users, as this is highly variable dependant on their type of activity in the system and the number of queries to the system at one specific time., nan\nProxy/login as, Stream\u2019s \u2018Login as\u2019 functionality allows admin users to log in to the front-end as any other user. It is not possible to access the admin portal when logged in as another user. All actions undertaken are logged via xAPI.\n\n, nan\nAudit Trail, A wide range of events that cause changes to the Stream DB are logged ready for audit purposes later. \n\nLogs are stored for 90 days.  \n\nThese changes include actions taken via the admin UI, user provisioning, and the APIs. \n\nNote: the audit log does not include learning records as these are stored in the Learning Record Store (LRS) as xAPI. \n, The SaaS stack clients (e.g. streamlxp.com) do not currently create audit logs. But they may in the future. If a customer wants this, right now it is better for them to be on a single-tenant stack.\nUptime, LXP uptime for the SaaS deployment for 2021 was 99.9988%., nan\nPasswords, Stream LXP can be set to require a password with an 8 character minimum with at least one number (e.g `2`), one character (e.g `a`), and one symbol (e.g `$`).\nAn Account Lockout feature is available, with a configurable number of attempts and lockout duration., Customers should be directed to SSO integration for more complex password requirements.\nContent Delivery Network (CDN), The LXP implements an AWS Cloudfront CDN, with content stored in S3, separate from the application infrastructure., nan\nCan the system track virtual/in-person instructor classroom hours?, Typically the time spent is recorded in the third party classroom software, provided this is xAPI compliant, this data can be captured by the LRS., nan\nWhat your process to identify, prioritize implement new features?, We are continually developing enhancements to our core products that are freely available for our customers to enjoy, thanks to our SaaS model. \nOur roadmap is informed by: \n- Client feature requests - either directly submitted, or submitted via a Customer Account Executive or during the sales process, or raised during a meeting, workshop or event. \n- Internal ideas - ideas from our learning innovation, product or tech teams, or the wider business. \n- Innovation Lab - our internal idea 'incubator'. This is focused on very new ideas - further away from the next iteration of our products\n- External ideas - things we see in terms of industry trends, best practice and expert views on learning and user experience\n- Technology - capability or need. When new technologies become available or the environment changes, we may need to change our own technology, or respond to the external change to keep our systems robust, secure and future-ready. New technology often also gives us new choices in the way we develop. \n\nHow do we design a new feature, product or update?\nWe use a process we've refined internally that\u2019s a type of Design Sprint. this has 4 stages:\n1. Understanding the problem\n2. Generating ideas\n3. Refine and decide\n4. Prototype and test\n\nWe use more or less the same approach every time, but different parts of the process varies depending on the type of problem and product. The team taking part in the \u2018sprint\u2019 includes people from around the business \u2013 always including those in client-facing roles as well as design, learning and product specialists.\n\nClient feature requests can either be directly submitted, or submitted via an Customer Account Executive or during the sales process, or raised during a meeting, workshop or event. When you submit an idea, you'll be asked (or your Customer Account Executive will help you) to re-frame the request as a problem to be solved and to check it\u2019s in line with the product vision.\n\nThen we ask for other information to help us understand the issue \u2013 like the nature of how it impacts your work. (If it\u2019s actually a bug, we'll pass it on to the development team for assessment, fixing and testing. If so, they may need to come back to you for more details to help them diagnose the issue.)\n\nBecause our products are generally complex, we have to address new features and re-designs at a high level (rather than just make lots of small changes that may be incoherent in the long run or affect other things).\nWe prioritize these bigger developments according to our roadmap. We review this every month, and prioritize according to criteria generally used for this type of decision making.\n\nClient requests feature mostly at the \u2018Understanding the problem\u2019 stage. This stage involves an extended period of looking at evidence to make sure the issue is well understood. We do things like look at information from clients (which is why we ask for information about impact, etc.), data and analytics from our systems, and interviewing \u2018experts\u2019 \u2013 this might include clients, Customer Account Executives, solutions and support, learning experts \u2013 internal or external, etc. We'll also review external information related to the problem so that we are up-to-date with current thinking and look at potential solutions \u2013 for example, how leading companies in other industries are tackling this problem.\n\nWe also look at client data to help us prioritize (we always have many more ideas than we can build), and we may come to you as a client or partner to help us with prototype testing. We test with a variety of types of user, always including both those who know the platform as it is, and those who know nothing at all about the way it works right now \u2013 this helps us balance designing the best solution possible vs managing and understanding the amount of change for our existing users.\n\n, nan\nTranslation, The Stream Authoring tool enables the same content to be translated into multiple languages which are all surfaced through the same Resource, removing the need for different versions for different languages. Content authored within Stream Authoring automatically detects the user's language from their Stream LXP profile and surfaces the right version of the content to them automatically. Users can also choose to consume the content in another language if they wish.    \nAll platform language is translated into over 40 languages. New languages can be added on demand (price on application). \nAll admin created vocabulary e.g. learning experience titles, descriptions, instructions, etc. can be surfaced in multiple languages through the same fields within the admin portal using our MLang functionality. The text is the surfaced to the front-end user in their profile language automatically.  , nan", "doc_id": "2d218ff0-8480-44b5-b700-a4b26d405f74", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "__type__": "Document"}, "4c28a1ce-591f-43a9-b784-c04d2f97f50e": {"text": "Migration, Our Solutions Engineering team are able to work with you to migrate your data as part of the implementation; this will require further discussion of the nature and quantity of data that needs to be migrated. We have a successful track record integrating historic completions, learner skill data, and HR data including complex international organisational structures.   \nCustomer data remains property of the customer. Our Solutions Engineering team will assess the correct location for the data depending upon it's nature, use, and structure including Stream LXP, Learning Locker LRS, and the Stream Analytics BI tool., nan\nPlease share your company's top 2 Lessons Learned from previous implementations, 1. Communication is key. The importance of regularly scheduled check-in calls between the delivery team and the customer result the most successful, on-time implementations. We have found that competing projects or customer resources can result in project delays, thus having multiple contacts within the line of business, IT, and L&D can alleviate any bottlenecks that arise.         2. Any KPI's or outcome-based achievments that the project is intended to address can be leveraged during implementation to impact user experience design. Workflows, mock-ups, or sample learning objects should be shared with the delivery team in order to create a more fluid user experience. Tell us what you envision the learner journey to be so we can design it proactively., nan\nPlease describe the biggest risks your company foresees during implementation., We are heavily customer facing throughout the process which is extremely iterative. Any successful project requires collaboration - we cannot create quality digital content without regularly talking to the client and encouraging feedback. Our PMs will run regular sessions to do so on a weekly basis. They\u2019ll be in constant touch with you to ensure the output meets expectations. We have a tried and tested PM process, based on experience and best practice. It\u2019s a waterfall style process based on a number of key sign off points.\n\nWe expect our relationship with you to be an open and collaborative partnership, and welcome the opportunity to agree appropriate performance measures with you at project kick off which we will monitor together in real time throughout the project via the weekly and monthly reporting mechanisms, and via our regular day-to-day collaboration on the project. \n\nExperience has taught us the following can impact projects:\n- Lack of customer engagement \n- Personnel changes/absence\n- Change requests post planning/setup phase\n- Updates outside of project review cycle\n\nWhile our Implementation Plan provides details exactly what is required to deliver this project, experience has taught us that theory alone is not enough. Risks can impact both LXP and e-learning projects and must be properly prepared for. In addition to preparing for the risks below, we will also initiate a risk register at project initiation and distribute this to all stakeholders. Our Project Manager will then facilitate a weekly review throughout the duration of the project which includes risks and issues.\nPotential risks to this project, and our mitigations for these, include:\nRisk\n- Personnel changes / absences - We will tackle this risk early, at the start of our project, when we are putting together our project plan. As much as possible, we will plan our solution delivery process accounting for planned absences. To prepare for unplanned or unexpected absences, we will also ask you to assign deputies that can stand-in for key project team members where possible, to avoid delays being caused by absences. Although we may plan for absences, delays can still occur with full project team availability. This is particularly common during sign-off stages, when key decisions have to be made.\n- Difficulties / delays during key sign-off stages of the project - We mitigate for this by giving you plenty of warning of these stages coming up, by managing expectations with honesty and by providing guidance and reassurance on realistic implications of each sign-off required.\n- Unplanned updates to requirements arise outside of the project review cycle and cause delays - Even with the best intentions and a practiced process, changes to solutions often still surface during a project and at unexpected times. Rather than let these put a stop to everything, we deal with unplanned updates to requirements alongside continuing the planned development. In rare cases when these changes are \u201cshowstoppers\u201d, we respond as quickly as possible to reach a decision and regain momentum with as small a delay as possible.\n\nImportantly, we do not only prepare for project risks, but also risks of challenges you may face even when everything is finished. When implementing your solution, we will provide a test version of the site for your team and stakeholders to get used to the functionality of the system, including any custom functionality made just for you. This helps us to mitigate any launch risks, and problem-solve any queries or concerns that your team have with the solution.\n\n, nan\n6.15.8 Please describe your process for providing customer-requested system enhancements and customizations.

The LXP has robust user provisioning for the ingestion of large scale user data including custom profile fields, hierarchies, roles, and historic completions. This can be implemented as a one-off or regular, ongoing integration and we have multiple methods of securely transfering this data;\n\n1. API - We have multiple APIs that can be calleed when you are looking to manage and maintain your user data. When using APIs the transfer of data is quick and efficient with real time updates being applied so that users are created, updated and removed automatically based on the HRIS data. \n\n2. CSV transfer - this is an alternative method where user data can be transferred via CSV to a SFTP server where it is consumed by the LXP process to add, update and remove users at a set frequency. \n\nIf required you can also manually manage user accounts through the UI/UX. User accounts, profile fields, additional frameworks covering positions and organisational structures can all be manually administrated fo any ad hoc changes or if you have user groups that sit outside of your dynamic process. , nan", "doc_id": "4c28a1ce-591f-43a9-b784-c04d2f97f50e", "embedding": null, "extra_info": null, "__type__": "Document"}, "d222a6fa-d38b-4669-a81a-94ccb94d9cc2": {"text": "Question , Answer, Last review date\nThird party content Integrations, We implement integrations once they are required by our clients.\nStream has existing custom middleware that transforms content metadata from third-party platforms and data sources into Stream Learning Experiences, which are instantly indexed and automatically tagged, ready for surfacing as recommendations or within Stream search.\nThis includes tagging related to content source, and also based on the theme, skill, or subject of the content, depending on the metadata available from the third-party content API.\nStream can integrate on a \u2018one for all\u2019 basis, where all third-party content is scraped and surfaced for learners within the LXP, or on a \u2018one to one\u2019 basis, where third-party content is scraped based on the enrolments of the individual user. This depends on the setup of the third-party and access rights offered by the API., nan\nHR integration, Stream can be integrated with third-party platforms to create a unified \u2018front-door\u2019 to learning, development, and performance support. Any integration would need to be understood and scoped, and we have a process and dedicated Solutions Engineering team for that, who will support you in the early stages of the project to ensure we get the right solution for your HR user data needs. Stream can integrate with any platform that has developed an LTI integration (Learning Tools Interoperability) which is the standard in the L&D space.\n\nWe have experience of integrating with HR systems such as Workday, with which we can provide a 2 way integration. User data including job roles, profile fields, skills, and levels can be extracted from Workday via API and ingested into Stream. Stream user data can be extracted via API and pushed to Workday. Please note, this integration would rely on access to API documentation supplied by the third-party vendor.\n\nOnce your HR user data is in Stream, your users can be grouped using the Audience functionality that would provide them with the appropriate level of access on the site, and assign them training content based on their role or position. , nan\nCustom Integrations, Yes - 2 way. We have developed middleware that allows for more efficient development of integrations with third-party learning platforms. The limitations on this are usually due to the third-party platform APIs, rather than Stream. \n\nStream also has robust user provisioning for the ingestion of large scale user data including custom profile fields, hierarchies, roles, and historic completions. This can be implemented as a one-off or regular, ongoing integration.\n\nThis requirement would be a custom integration. We provide an integration service that can work through a scoping phase to ensure we fully understand and have documented the desired process. This would be done with our solutions engineering team. The platform has an extensive range of available API\u2019s that can be leveraged to facilitate the integration and we have the necessary capability to carry out any development work required. , nan\nWhat ticketing tools can you integrate with?

Integrations are implemented in partnership with our clients on a case by case basis. The Learning Pool Solutions Engineering team will partner with you to understand your requirements and the possibilities available from Salesforce. We would need to scope this requirement further to get a better understanding of your requirement and existing infrastructure. Our flexible API can allow you to surface data from Stream into Salesforce.\nWe have successfully integrated our platforms with Salesforce for other customers, one example being Valvoline. As their learner base are heavy users of Salesforce, Valvoline used Single Sign On to provide a direct link to to their Stream \u2018Sales Training Center\u2018 through the Salesforce dashboard, as shown on the image below. This led to an increase in usage of the learning platform. You can learn more about our partnership with Valvoline here. , nan\nZoom integration , LTI integration with platforms like Zoom enable easy implementation of virtual Instructor Led Training as LXs, so all learners are in a session together. This can be surfaced alongside assigned and recommended learning to blend synchronous elements with asynchronous individual learning. \n\nWhen accessed via Stream, Zoom understands who your learners are, what their role is, and what Learning Experience they are viewing. Zoom provides a specific UI/UX to match this. For example:\nLearner: join and attend webinars\nInstructor: create, edit, start, and delete webinars  \n\nAdmins can create and manage a number of Zoom webinar sessions for the same Learning Experience. When accessing the Zoom webinar via a Stream Learning Experience, learners only see the webinars related to that specific Learning Experience. They can see multiple sessions for the same Learning Experience. , nan\nSalesforce integration , Our platforms have been designed to play a central, pivotal role in your learning ecosystem.

The learning experiences can be defaulted to secret to allow for manual curation and assignment by administrators if required.  , nan\nGamification Platforms integration, Yes - 2 way. This depends on the availablilty of the required data and connections within the third-party gamification platforms via API.  , nan\nWhat workforce tools does your system integrate with to support learning in the flow of work?, Stream can be integrated with third-party platforms to create a unified \u2018front-door\u2019 to learning, development, and performance support. Any integration needs to be scoped in detail, and we have a process and dedicated team for that, who will follow up at the right stage. Stream can integrate with any platform that has developed an LTI integration (Learning Tools Interoperability) which is the standard in the L&D space., nan\nDoes your solution support real-time integrations? If not, what is the latency period?, The Stream API is real-time, allowing for changes and updates to the application to be made in response to user actions., nan\nDoes your solution support modern integration technologies? If YES, please provide examples for flexible, agile and digital integrations, Stream provides an API covering most platform functionality. This allows for integrations to be created by Learning Pool or customers using the provided API documentation.\n\nTo demonstrate the capabilities Learning Pool have collaborated with Anders Pink to create an integration between the two platforms. This integration puts Anders Pink articles straight onto learner\u2019s dashboards, increasing choice for your learners and driving engagement. Allow content to be instantly surfaced in Stream, or manually curate the results for full control. Refine briefings to drive engagement by identifying the most viewed sources, popular times for consumption, and most preferred content type.\n\nhttps://learningpool.com/solutions/learning-experience-platform/anders-pink/, nan\nInterfaces - HR and others (Workday, SAP, HR, CRM, Web Conferencing, Social Media, third party provider such as LinkedIn Learning, Of Course Me, Speexx, MS Teams, CRM/Salesforce, Customer Service Knowledgebase, authoring tools, LXT, etc. )\u200b, Stream can be integrated with third-party platforms to create a unified \u2018front-door\u2019 to learning, development, and performance support.

To do this we will focus on the facts. One of the first tasks will be to quantify the priority and effect on the business. This will help to ensure that the correct resource and priority is assigned to the escalation. We will then investigate and report in a timely fashion. \nStage II: Having investigated we will document the finding and recommend a course of action. The findings will typically outline what has happened along with a timeframe.  We will detail any critical decisions that have been taken, points of failure and recommendations to resolve and improve on current processes if necessary.\nWe expect that an initial written response will be provided within 48 business hours. If you are not happy with the response provided you can request the next level in the escalation hierarchy to review.\n\nAward winning support\nLearning Pool customer support is award-winning.
